# Visual Proof of the Universal Approximation Theorem for a Neural Network with a Single Hidden Layer

## Introduction

So whatâ€™s the goal ? The goal is to visually proof that we can approximate any arbitrary 3d function with a neural network, even when the network has just one hidden layer. 
A 3d function might look like this:
